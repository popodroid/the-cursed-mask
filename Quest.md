**Introduction**

The High Priest of Entrana seems deeply concerned about a young apprentice monk named Brother Thaddeus.
He recently sent the timid scholar on a “spiritual journey” to investigate a minor, “mostly harmless” curse on the distant island of Mos Le’Harmless.
The priest believes the pilgrimage will teach him courage, faith, and strength.

Brother Thaddeus had always been a fearful soul. Even as a child, while other boys played knights with their wooden swords, he hid among book shelves of an old monastery — finding comfort not in swords, but in scriptures.
The world frightened him, but knowledge never did.

In those quiet libraries he devoured tales of gods, curses, and ancient materials — knowledge that now makes him both valuable and vulnerable.

Starting Up

The High Priest admits one small oversight: Brother Thaddeus’s route to Mos Le’Harmless leads straight through Port Phasmatys, the town of ghosts — and the boy fears everything. And he does not have a ghostspeak amulet with him.
Without the Ghostspeak Amulet, he’ll never make it past the ghost town.

The priest asks you to find Brother Thaddeus in Port Phasmatys and deliver an amulet before his courage fails him.
If the player doesn’t already have one, Father Urhney can provide a spare.

The Drunken Monk

The player finds Brother Thaddeus inside the Port Phasmatys Inn — slumped over a table, clearly drunk.
When spoken to, he only slurs a few incoherent prayers, and the Ghost Innkeeper quickly intervenes.
To understand the ghost, the player must be wearing a Ghostspeak Amulet or Morytania legs.

The innkeeper explains that Brother Thaddeus hasn’t paid for his drinks and, worse, has been scaring away paying customers — most ghosts don’t feel comfortable drinking beside a holy man.
He wants the young monk out of his inn, but refuses to let Thaddeus leave until his bar tab and the inn’s losses are covered.

The player can settle the debt for 10,000 coins.

Once paid, the innkeeper sighs in relief and advises:

“If you really want to help the lad, sober him up. A quick dip in the cold sea should do it.”

The player must then convince the suspicious and swaying monk to follow them to the docks — a task requiring the Ring of Charos (a) to charm him into obedience.

The player carefully leads the staggering Brother Thaddeus out of the inn and toward the docks. The monk stumbles along, mumbling half-finished prayers and occasionally stopping to apologise to ghosts he thinks he’s offended.
At the end of the dock, the player suggests he step closer to the edge “for some fresh air.”

Cutscene starts

Before Thaddeus can protest, the player gives him a firm shove — sending him tumbling into the cold sea below.
With a loud splash and a burst of sputtering, the drenched monk surfaces.
The shock of the icy water snaps him instantly sober.

“By Saradomin’s mercy… I think I’ve just been baptised… by force.”

Embarrassed but grateful, Brother Thaddeus hauls himself back onto the dock, dripping wet but clear-headed — and shivering.
When the player tries to speak to him, he only stammers and waves a trembling hand.

Cutscene ends

When the player tries to talk to Brother Thaddeus, he shivers:

“T-t-too c-c-cold…”

He refuses to say more, curling up for warmth.
The player receives a prompt:

“Maybe I should make a fire to warm up the monk.”

The player must light a fire next to him.
Once warmed by the flames, Brother Thaddeus regains his composure — and begins to talk.

Thaddeus admits why he was drinking. He confesses that his fear of ghosts has grown unbearable; that he thought “a little courage in a bottle” might help him overcome it.
But instead of finding courage, he found only shame. He then vows to face his fears with a clear and sober mind.

As the warmth returns to his hands, so does his purpose.
He remembers his mission: to investigate the cursed energy on Mos Le’Harmless.
Despite his fear, he insists on continuing — but begs the player to escort him across the sea.

The Sea Voyage

The player agrees to escort Brother Thaddeus to Mos Le’Harmless aboard their boat. (Requires a skiff with no crewmates.)
The young monk spends most of the voyage clinging to the railing, muttering half-remembered prayers each time a wave slaps the hull.

The Ship Graveyard

Their route cuts through the Ship Graveyard — a tangle of splintered masts and half-sunken hulls, the remains of merchant vessels plundered and sunk by pirates over the years.
This section plays as a Barracuda Trails-style sailing challenge, requiring careful steering through wreckage and floating debris.

Cutscene starts

The sea begins to churn violently...
From the depths rises a massive ghostly galleon, its hull covered in barnacles and coral. The wind catches its wet, tattered, grime-stained sails.
Ghost pirates appear upon the deck, drawing their cutlasses.
The giant galleon starts pursuing the player's boat, ramming through the obstacles.

Cutscene ends

The player navigates through the course trying to avoid obstacles and keeping their speed up in order to escape the pursuing ghost pirate ship.
If the ghost pirates catch up, they ram and sink and plunder the skiff emptying the player's cargo hold. The player and Brother Thaddeus are then washed back to Port Phasmatys.
The player must pay the shipwright to recover the damaged vessel before retrying.

At the end of the course, the player’s nimble skiff whizzes between two towering rocks.

Cutscene starts

The player stops their boat and looks back.
The pursuing galleon cannot follow. The ghost pirates yell and wave their swords angrily as the galleon slowly submerges back into the sea, leaving the pair free to sail on.

Cutscene ends
Finding the Landing Spot

Once the danger has passed, Brother Thaddeus refuses to dock at Mos Le’Harmless itself.
His fear of pirates overwhelms him; even approaching the town’s harbour sends him into a panic.
If the player attempts to sail toward the southern shore, he stops them and pleads to turn away.

While they drift near the island’s north-eastern coast, the monk says:

“That is where the cursed energy is coming from… I can feel it in the wind itself.”

He urges the player to land there, convinced it is the true source of the corruption.
The player decides to moor on the island.

The Sea Horror

As the skiff nears the small island, the Sea Horror erupts from the depths — a kraken-like beast covered in jagged blackstone shards.
The player must defeat the creature in sea combat before mooring.

The Sea Horror has similar stats to Vampire Kraken, but has one special attack:

The Sea Horror occasionally charges up and emits a dark pulse damaging both boat and the player.

During the battle, Brother Thaddeus chants trembling but determined prayers that momentarily strengthen the skiff’s defences and mend small amounts of hull damage.
Though terrified, his faith holds firm — and for the first time, he fights back against his fear.

The Small Island

With the Sea Horror defeated, the player and Brother Thaddeus finally moor the skiff on the shore of the small island.

Cutscene starts

Without hesitation — perhaps eager to prove his courage — Thaddeus rushes inside.
Moments later, he staggers back out, bloodied and barely standing.
Between gasps, he manages to explain that the cave is swarming with Cave Horrors — creatures he recognises from his readings in The Slayer Skill Guide.
He ran out of prayer points during the sea horror fight and he had no Witchwood Icon to protect himself, so he had nothing to defend against them.
Their physical strength and awful howling nearly tore apart his body and mind.
The monk collapses on the shore, pale and trembling.

Cutscene ends

Brother Thaddeus is too weak to eat, too traumatised to drink a potion — and without help, he won’t survive.

Finding a Pirate Doctor

The player realises that on an island of pirates, there must surely be a doctor — with all the sword fights, cannon “mishaps,” and rum-induced disasters, someone must patch them up regularly.
Determined to save Brother Thaddeus, the player travels to Mos Le’Harmless in search of medical aid.

The player then must ask around and find out if there is any kind of doctor on the island.
Without the Book o’ Piracy, the local pirates respond in indecipherable slang.
With it, however, their rambling becomes just barely understandable.

Here are some pirate responses:

“The Doc? Aye, Dockter Salty B. Jonesy! Hah! He wanders more than a captain’s compass in a whirlpool.
Sometimes by the tavern, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes talkin’ to crabs.
Ye’ll find ‘im sooner or later... but for the love o’ the sea, don’t ask ‘bout the B.”

“Dr. Jones, aye, I knows ‘im.
Smartest fool on the island. Also the drunkest.
Once tried to cure seasickness with gunpowder. Worked… sort of.
Don’t know where he is, but listen close, landlubber — don’t ask ‘bout the B.”

“Aye, I’ve seen the Doc! Saw ‘im wanderin’ near the docks, I did —
and I can tell even after six rums, it were definitely him!
He was hummin’ sea shanties to a barrel o’ fish guts, lookin’ mighty pleased with hisself.
But take me word, mate… don’t ye dare ask ‘im ‘bout the B.”

Unique answer from Cavey Davey:

Cavey Davey: “Doc Jones, eh? Might be me brother, come t’ think of it… not that I’d swear on it. Hard t’ tell with all the rum an’ the years.
But I do know this — our folks both went down in the same bloody sea battle.
So maybe we’re kin… or maybe the sea just decided t’ make us both ugly.
Anyways, ain’t seen the lad in a while — probably out there talkin’ to his crabs again.
An’ listen here, mate… don’t go askin’ ’bout the B. Maybe it does stand for Business — or maybe it stands for Buried.
Either way, I wouldn’t test it, mate.”

Following the most recent sighting, the player eventually tracks down the doctor — Dr. Salty B. Jones, pirate surgeon, miracle worker, and proud rum enthusiast.

After a short talk with the doctor, the player learns that the doctor has been wandering the island because he is in search of a buried rum stash — a chest full of premium rum.
He buried it himself while drunk and now can’t seem to locate it.

The player helps Dr. Salty B. Jones locate his rum. The doctor then agrees to help the wounded monk.

The Shortcut and the “Cure”

Dr. Salty B. Jones agrees to help save Brother Thaddeus.
The pirate doctor then tells the player that he knows a shortcut and asks the player to follow him.

Cutscene starts

“I knows a shortcut, ye scurvy landlubber. Stick close an’ try not t’ break yer neck.”

He leads the player to the northeastern shore of Mos Le’Harmless, where the small isle is.
After rummaging through his medical bag, he produces a mithril grapple and a rune crossbow — apparently standard pirate medical equipment.

With a grin, he fires the grapple across the stream, anchoring it to a sturdy tree on the other side, wraps another end around the tree on the main island and ties the rope tight.

“There! Easier than payin’ port fees. Keep yer balance, and try not t’ go swimmin’.”

The player then walks across balancing on the rope to the small island, followed by the surprisingly agile doctor.

Despite his questionable hygiene and even more questionable instruments, the doctor gets to work immediately.
He operates on the unconscious Thaddeus with a mix of rum, instinct, and improvised surgery.

His techniques are bizarre — glowing syringes, muttered sea shanties, and the occasional splash of grog — yet somehow, they work.
Moments later, Brother Thaddeus gasps awake, dazed but alive.

He blinks up at his rescuer, speechless with gratitude.
Something inside him shifts — the fear that once ruled him begins to dissolve.
Being saved by a pirate changes his perspective entirely: not all rogues are villains, and courage can take many forms.

Dr. Salty B. Jones, proudly declaring the patient cured, uses his surprising agility once again and flees toward Mos Le’Harmless.

Cutscene ends

Brother Thaddeus thanks the player.
His body healed and his courage restored, he determinedly vows to return to the cave.

The Cave

Guided by the renewed courage in his heart, Brother Thaddeus insists on returning to the caves beneath Mos Le’Harmless to uncover the truth behind the curse.
He asks the player to bring him some food (five pieces of lobster or better), a prayer potion and a Witchwood Icon.

After the player has given the supplies to Brother Thaddeus, they and the monk are ready to descend the stairs.

Brother Thaddeus guides the player, appearing as overhead text:

“West! Keep going west!”
“North here — the curse is stronger that way!”
“Don’t stop! Keep going south!”

Following the monk’s directions, the player and Thaddeus reach a narrow alcove carved into the western wall — a small hollow where neither Cave Horror nor Albino Bat can fit.
Deep in the alcove Brother Thaddeus notices a hidden entrance.

The player and Brother Thaddeus enter.
On the other side there is an old abandoned secret chamber.
There are ritual markings, a black mask carving station, a dark shrine and many scattered notes.

The player and Brother Thaddeus begin to investigate notes, markings and symbols.
Through investigation, the pair learn that this secret chamber belongs to some kind of cult.
There were mentions of “the ancient pillar” on the island.

They find notes about a nameless sea-born deity — an entity of madness and shadow, some kind of malevolent and mysterious being, which they believed to be buried beneath Mos Le’Harmless.
Oddly, all the notes about this entity are written based on theory, including no confirmed information.
They were digging to find this mysterious entity.

To achieve this, cultists have been crafting cursed black masks and placing them upon Jungle Horrors, enslaving the creatures to do their digging on their behalf.

The player and Brother Thaddeus learn that Black Masks are crafted from large chunks of blackstone.
The notes are messy. There are mentions of a curse that bends the wielder's mind.
However, the curse only seems to affect creatures with weak or simple minds, which is why most humans remain unaffected when wearing the black mask.

In the room there is a diary. Reading the diary, the player learns that cultists had done an experiment on one of the captured Jungle Horrors.
Instead of just a mask, they reinforced its very bones with cursed blackstone, making them more durable and faster in order to speed up this slow digging operation.

The experiment was a failure. The curse took over, the horror mutated, grew in size, was uncontrollable, attacked the cultists and started killing their troops.
Instead of Horror, they named it the Cave Terror.

Cultists who survived the attack were lost in the caves and killed by Cave Horrors.
The writer of this diary was one of them. They somehow survived and retreated back to the chamber.
They were stuck between the Horrors and the Terror — later, they starved to death.

Cutscene starts

Brother Thaddeus opens a sealed crate. It’s full of black masks. The crate has a “Take-from” option. (Take-from Crate Full of Black Masks)

Brother Thaddeus takes one and says:
“Maybe we can learn more about those.”

Thaddeus places the mask inside his satchel — the ground begins to shake, a rhythmic rumble, like something pummeling against the walls of this very room!

The vibrations grow stronger. Dust cascades from the ceiling — and then comes the roar.
The wall bursts open, stone and soil exploding into the room.

Through the smoke lumbers a monstrous silhouette — the Cave Terror, a towering mutation of a Cave Horror, its limbs swollen with muscle and shards of blackstone jutting through its flesh.
Its body is twisted and grotesque, bones broken long ago and healed the wrong way. Each limb ends in enormous claws reinforced with blackstone. It has an oversized black mask fused into its skull.

The monster steps into the room and starts thrashing around, destroying everything in the room — even the crate full of masks that had the “take-from” option on it.
(Truly sad thing for all the ironmen going dry for the mask.)

The creature then bellows, and the world itself seems to twist under the force of the sound.
The howl is not merely loud — it drills into the mind, vibrating behind the eyes, tearing thoughts apart from within.

The player reels as vision warps and blurs; Brother Thaddeus collapses to his knees, hands clamped over his ears, screaming in silent agony.

“We can’t fight that… not yet,” he gasps between ragged breaths.
“That thing’s howl — it tears the soul apart. The curse has consumed it completely!”

Thaddeus feels a burst of adrenaline and dashes out of the chamber.

Cutscene ends

The player should leave the chamber as well since they have no means to fight this monstrosity yet.

Leaving the Cave

After leaving the chamber, the player talks to Brother Thaddeus:

Thaddeus: “We… we can’t stay here. That thing’s howl — it’s like having your skull split open from the inside.”

The player: “We’ll need help. Maybe a Slayer Master would know how to deal with something like that.”

Thaddeus: “A Slayer Master… yes. There is one — my great-uncle, Thalos the Deep. He lives here on Mos Le’Harmless… or at least, he used to.
I’ve not seen him since I was a boy. My family said he left the mainland years ago, took to the sea, and never came back the same.
They said he spent too long studying sea beasts — started seeing things that weren’t there.
But if half the stories are true, he knows more about curses and monsters than anyone alive.”

The player: “Let’s find this Thalos!”

The player and Brother Thaddeus then traverse out of the cave.

When exiting the cave, worried Cavey Davey asks them about the rumbling and terrifying howling that he had heard.
The player and Thaddeus explain the situation at hand and ask where they can find Thalos the Deep.

Cavey Davey tells them that Thalos resides in a small seashore hut near the docks, south-west in the town.
Cavey Davey decides to investigate the cave himself and heads inside.

Thalos the Deep

Following Cavey Davey’s directions, the player and Brother Thaddeus find a small seaside hut at the edge of Mos Le’Harmless.
It’s half-built from shipwreck planks and patched with rope and barnacle-stained boards — the kind of place only an old sea dog could call home.

Cutscene starts

Thalos the Deep: “Well, I’ll be… Thaddeus, isn’t it? Little Taddy! My nephew!”

Thaddeus: “You — you know me?”

Thalos: “Aye, lad. Word travels faster than a gull in a storm on this island. That quack, Dr. Salty B. Jones, came stumblin’ by last night — babblin’ about some half-dead monk who looked just like me back when I still had both knees and a decent beard.

He’s patched me up more times than I’d like t’ remember — sewed me shut, drained me, even stitched my own shadow back on once, or so he claimed. Mad as a barnacle, but he’s good with a blade… the surgical kind, anyway.

Just — listen well, lad — never ask him about the B.
I once knew a pirate who did.
Can’t remember his name no more. Probably ‘cause no one’s seen him since.”

“Doc said ya faced a cave full o’ horrors and lived to tell the tale. I figured it could only be one o’ my kin — and here ye are, drippin’ with courage and probably seawater!”

Thaddeus: “Then you truly are my uncle Thalos the Deep… the Slayer Master.”

Thalos: “Aye. The Sea-Slayer Master, more or less. Spent half my life fightin’ sea beasts, and the other half losin’ parts of me to ’em.
Lost this eye wrestlin’ a swordfish once — stubborn thing tried to drag me off the boat. Still got the scar… and the swordfish.

And that giant white shark… a pesky brute. Ripped off me leg clean as a fillet. Haven’t seen it since — though I reckon it still remembers me.”

Thalos’s laughter fades as his gaze drifts to the Black Mask tucked in Thaddeus’s satchel. His tone hardens immediately, all mirth gone.

The warmth of the reunion fades, the conversation turns grim.
The player and Brother Thaddeus recount everything — the voyage through the Ship Graveyard, the Sea Horror’s attack, the chamber, and the monstrous Cave Terror that shattered the chamber walls.

Thaddeus takes the Black Mask from his satchel and gives it to Thalos.

Thalos: “Blackstone… But this isn’t just stone — it’s cursed right down t’ its marrow.
That weight ye feel, that’s not the stone, that’s madness. A curse that grips tight to whoever wields it.”

“But there’s somethin’ curious here. When ye merge a Black Mask with an Enchanted Gem — the curse lightens. Burns away part o’ it.
That’s why a Black Mask weighs ten kilos, and a Slayer Helmet barely two. The gem purifies the weight o’ the curse itself.”

“I’ll keep this for study — see what secrets it hides. But that beast ye spoke of… the Cave Terror — that’s the real storm brewin’.”

Thaddeus: “Its howl alone could kill. Even the Witchwood Icon couldn’t protect us.”

Thalos squints toward the horizon, deep in thought.

Thalos: “Hmm. Can’t silence a storm… but maybe ye can match its wind. The lesser horrors howl too, aye?
What if their howls could be turned against the big one? Catch the noise — make it fight itself.”

His good eye gleams with sudden inspiration.

Thalos: “Aye. We’ll enhance yer Witchwood Icon — turn it into a Witchwood Howl Collector. A whistle o’ sorts, tuned t’ their screams. That oughta do it.”

“First, gather yer ingredients:
– A Bucket o’ Honey, for the binding — keeps it pure and holds the dust in place.
– A Bucket o’ Sap from an Evergreen — sticky enough to seal, but not so thick it plugs the sound.
– A handful o’ Charcoal, ground to fine dust — that’ll help the sap set firm and true.
– One Enchanted Gem, crushed fine — gives the whole brew a spark o’ purity to fight the curse.”

“Mix the sap and charcoal first till it turns dark and smooth, then stir in the honey and gem dust.
Should shine just a little, like wet obsidian.

Coat the inside of yer hollow branch with the stuff, fix it to yer Witchwood Icon, and leave it in the sun to dry.
When it hardens, ye’ll have a Witchwood Howl Collector Whistle that’s light, strong, and hungry for noise.”

Cutscene ends

The Fight

With the Witchwood Howl Collector fully charged, the player returns to the hidden chamber deep within the tunnels.

As the player approaches, Cavey Davey is found in the alcove, inspecting fallen stones.

Cavey Davey: “Blimey… I knew the ground weren’t supposed to breathe. Ye’d best be careful in there, adventurer — that roar still rattlin’ the walls.”

The player steps into the ruined chamber, now partially collapsed and dripping with seawater.
The Cave Terror is found in the middle of the room, claws scraping against the stone floor.
It raises its head and unleashes a bone-rattling howl.

The player activates the Howl Collector, releasing a surge of collected echoes.
The whistle emits a continuous, resonant vibration that cancels out the monster’s deafening cries.

The Cave Terror fights with brutal, erratic strength — each movement a mix of fury and pain.
It uses a combination of attacks:

Burrowing Lunge: Digs into the earth and bursts upward beneath the player, sending debris flying and raining back down around the emerging area.

Rock Hurl: Scrapes the ground and flings stones in a wide arc; damage spreads the farther they travel.

Cursed Pulse: Stops, charges up a while and releases a shockwave of cursed energy.

Thrash: Leaps and flails violently, striking everything nearby without sense of direction — smart adventurers keep their distance.

The creature hits hard and moves unpredictably.
When reduced to 0 hitpoints, the Cave Terror collapses to the ground, trembling.

Anchoring the Beast
Cutscene starts

As the beast collapses, Brother Thaddeus and Cavey Davey rush into the chamber.
The massive creature lies still, faint wisps of blackstone energy fading from its body.

Thaddeus: “Is it… over?”
Cavey Davey: “Aye, it’s down — but I don’t think it’s dead.”

The Cave Terror twitches weakly, its chest still rising and falling.

Thaddeus: “It’s alive. Saradomin preserve us… it’s alive.”

Cavey Davey: “Alive and cursed, looks like. Beast like that can’t die — not while that blackstone’s clingin’ to its bones.”

He shakes his head slowly.

Cavey Davey: “The thing’s immortal. But maybe… maybe it don’t have to be dangerous no more.”

The Cave Terror lies crippled but alive.

Cavey Davey: “We’ll anchor the beast! Chain it down like a cursed ship!
If it can’t die, we’ll make sure it don’t wander neither.”

He gestures toward the center of the chamber.

Cavey Davey: “We’ll need a proper anchor, mind ye. Not some toy — a real one.
There’s an old one up on Mos Le’Harmless’s north shore. I’ve seen one there, half buried in the sand.”

Cavey Davey: “We’ll need somethin’ heavy — a real anchor. There’s one up north, rustin’ in the sand.
Problem is, movin’ that beast’ll take a miracle.”

Thaddeus: “Wait — I’ve read about something like this! In The Grim Tales!
The adventurer there used a potion called Shrink-Me-Quick to make themselves small enough to fit in a mouse hole!
And the beanstalk! It was also shrunken by that potion! It worked on a plant, why not iron?
If such a potion exists… perhaps we could use it on the anchor!”

Cavey Davey: “Shrinkin’ anchors now, are we? Heh! Mad as a cabin rat… but I like it.”

Cutscene ends

The player travels to the northern shore of Mos Le’Harmless, where a massive rusted anchor lies half-buried among the rocks.
The player mixes a Shrink-Me-Quick potion, then pours it over the anchor.

The anchor shrinks — it is still big and heavy, but now small enough to carry with both arms (resembling the size and weight of a Barrelchest’s Anchor).

The player carries the anchor back through the tunnels into the Cave Terror’s chamber, where Cavey Davey and Brother Thaddeus have already dug a wide pit in the center of the area.

As the player clicks ‘throw the anchor into the pit’:

Cutscene starts

The player hurls the anchor into the pit — the effect of the potion wears off, and the anchor grows back to its full size.

From the doorway, Thalos the Deep appears.

Thalos: “Well I’ll be… ye actually did it! Came t’ check if ye’d gone and gotten yourself eaten, but looks like the howl catcher worked, eh?”

He glances at the massive anchor now half-buried in the stone floor, then nods to himself.

Thalos: “Alright then — let’s make it official.”

Thalos grabs a coil of iron chain lying nearby — the same kind used to moor ships in storms.
With sailor’s precision and the ease of long habit, he strides to the beast, looping the chain twice around its thick neck.

The Cave Terror thrashes weakly, but Thalos doesn’t flinch.
With one final pull, the chain locks tight.

Thalos wipes his brow and exhales a gravelly laugh.

Thalos: “Aye… that’ll hold. Don’t reckon he’ll be diggin’ his way out o’ that one.”

He turns to the group.

Thalos: “Now if ye’ll excuse me — there’s a pint with my name on it down at House o’ Rum. Harpoon Joe owes me a drink or five.”

Thalos exits the chamber.

Cavey Davey: “Well… if that ain’t the wildest day I’ve had this week. What say we follow the old man’s lead, eh?”

Brother Thaddeus agrees.
They leave the chamber.

Cutscene ends
The Celebration

The player then follows his friends to Harpoon Joe’s — The House o’ Rum.

Cutscene starts

The Player, Thalos the Deep, Brother Thaddeus, Cavey Davey, and Doctor Salty B. Jones are surrounded by a dozen pirates — all celebrating the day’s victory.
The crowd cheers and drinks deeply throughout the night.

Thaddeus, rosy-cheeked and clearly on his first encounter with pirate rum, laughs nervously.

Thaddeus: “Doctor Jones, if I may ask… everyone keeps warning me not to ask, but— what is the B for?”

The entire tavern falls silent.
Doctor Salty B. Jones freezes mid-sip.
Thalos chokes on his drink.
Cavey Davey whispers:
“Oh, by the seas, lad… ye didn’t.”

Jones sets down his mug with exaggerated care.
He leans forward, a shadow falling across his scarred face.

Dr. Jones (quietly): “The B… stands for…”
He pauses dramatically.

“…Barrels!”

He bursts out laughing, slapping the table so hard his drink spills.
The pirates erupt in howling laughter, half of them pounding the table, the other half still not sure if it was a joke.

Dr. Jones: “What else would it be, ye bilge-suckin’ landlubbers?!”

The entire tavern roars with laughter again.

Thaddeus exhales, both relieved and more confused than ever.

Thalos grins, raising his mug.

Thalos: “He changes what the B stands for every time someone asks. Been at it so long, I doubt he remembers what it was t’ begin with.”

Cavey Davey: “Aye, last week it was Booze, week before that Bones, an’ now he swears it stands for Business.”

Thalos: “Hah! Only business that man knows is between a bottle an’ his liver.”

“To the B, then — whatever cursed thing it means!”

Mugs clash, rum splashes, and a new shanty begins:

“Yo-ho, to the monk and the sea,
To the beast what sleeps, and the mystery o’ B!”

The camera pans back as laughter fills the tavern, glowing with warmth and firelight.
The heroes — pirate, priest, slayer, and doctor — share one last toast together.

Cutscene ends

The player then wakes up at the shore near Thalos’s hut.
Brother Thaddeus is in the hut with Thalos.

The player asks Thaddeus if they are ready to leave back to Entrana.
Thaddeus agrees to leave but he has a bad hangover and asks the player to dock their boat at the docks of Mos Le’Harmless and inform him when they are ready to leave.

The player and Brother Thaddeus then sail back to Entrana, where the worried High Priest is waiting.
They tell the High Priest that there was just a minor, mostly harmless curse and it’s dealt with.
